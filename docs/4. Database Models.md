# Database Models

Our server needs a way to store data like news, songs and user info. This is the job of the database. We will use a type of database called SQL database. It stores data in a table format. Each <em>column</em> describes a property, like the <b>name</b> of a user. Each <em>row</em> represents an object we'd like to store, like a <b>user</b>.

To abstract away gnarly details of interacting directly with the database we will use an ORM (Object Relational Mapper) called SQLAlchemy. This lets us work on Python objects to create, delete and modify our data, while the ORM handles the lower level operations.

The database models will be defined in a seperate file called `database.py`. Here is an example of how to define a database model:

```py
from typing import Optional
from sqlalchemy import String
from sqlalchemy.orm import DeclarativeBase, MappedAsDataclass, Mapped, mapped_column


class BaseModel_DB(DeclarativeBase, MappedAsDataclass):
    pass


class BookInDB(BaseModel_DB):
    __tablename__ = "book_table"

    # Integer value, makred a primary key. Every table need one primary key column.
    # init=False makes this field NOT required when creating a BookInDB
    id: Mapped[int] = mapped_column(primary_key=True, init=False)

    # String value, max length 200
    title: Mapped[str] = mapped_column(String(200))

    # Integer column
    page_count: Mapped[int] = mapped_column()

    # Float column
    rating: Mapped[float] = mapped_column()

    # Optional (Nullable) string column. Instances of BookInDB will have a summary type of str or None
    # init=False to omit from constructor
    summary: Mapped[Optional[str]] = mapped_column(init=False)

    # Equivalent definition
    # summary: Mapped[str | None] = mapped_column(init=False)


    # A default value can be provided.
    # This defines the default value of "num" argument in constructor
    read_times: Mapped[int] = mapped_column(default=0)

```

## Writing to database

We create instances of a database models and feed desired values into the constructor like:

```py
new_book = BookInDB(title="Moby Thicc", page_count=150, rating=8.6)
```

Creating an instance of our database model will however not save it into database automatically. It has not left Python-land yet. For this we need a database session in which we can talk and send data to database. Our route function <em>Depends</em> on this <em>Session</em>.

```py

from fastapi import Depends, FastAPI
from db_models import BookInDB
from database import get_db
from sqlalchemy.orm import Session

app = FastAPI()


@app.post("/book")
def create_book(db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    new_book = BookInDB(title="Moby Thicc", page_count=150, rating=8.7)

    # new_book has no id here

    db.add(new_book)
    db.commit()
    db.refresh(new_book)

    # database has now given new_book an id

    print('Book after adding', new_book)
    return {"message": "Book was created!"}

```

`Depends` will run `get_db` upon a request to `/book`, and gives us the result in `db`. When we `return`, the request is has been handled and the session will be closed.

- `db.add(new_book)` will stage our object for writing.
- `db.commit()` writes changes to DB.
- `db.refresh(new_book)` update `new_book`. The Python object only gets an `id` after being inserted into DB. Refresh to get the `id`.

Note, this is not a realistic POST route yet as we do not accept request data. Parameters to BookInDB are hardcoded.

## Reading from database

To fetch data from database, use `db.query()`. Here we define routes for requesting all books, or requesting one by id. The `book_id` is a <em>path parameter</em>.

```py
@app.get("/book")
def get_books(db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    all_books = db.query(BookInDB).all()
    return all_books


@app.get("/book/{book_id}")
def get_one_book(book_id: int, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    one_book = db.query(BookInDB).filter(BookInDB.id == book_id).first()
    return one_book
```
