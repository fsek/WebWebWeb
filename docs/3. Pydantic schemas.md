# Models example

Let's have a look at `Models` in FastAPI. 

If we look back at example 2, a body of type `dict[str , str]` would not be very helpful! Instead, we will use pydantic to structure our request and response data. FastAPI uses these pydantic models for validation.

```py
from pydantic import BaseModel

class User(BaseModel):
    email: str
    name: str | None #A string or None
    password: str
```
If we, like the previous example, want to make signup POST route. But this time, instead of using only an email, we create a user object containing the email. 

```py
user_list: list[User] = []

@app.post("/signup")
def sign_up(user: User):
    user_list.append(user)
    return user
```

Using a model the HTTP body sent along with the POST request the framework validates that the data is structured in this specific way. 

Additionally, you typically want the response to be the data that you just created. We want to structure the response. This can be done using response models. 

```py
from pydantic import BaseModel

class UserOut(BaseModel):
    email: str
    name: str | None
```

In this example, the UserOut model doesn't include the password because, usually, returning the password isn't something that the response should include. 

```py
user_list: list[User] = []

@app.post("/signup", response_model=UserOut)
def sign_up(user: User):
    user_list.append(user)
    return user
```

By modifying the earlier POST function by adding `response_model=UserOut` the framework will filter the User object according the the response model, in this case, UserOut. Here the password will therefore be filtered out.
