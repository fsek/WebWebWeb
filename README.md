# WebWebWeb

Install these VSCode extensions:

- [Python](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python)
- [Black Formatter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.black-formatter)
- [SQLite Viewer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=qwtel.sqlite-viewer)

VSCode should not inconsitently highlight errors on different machines. Therefore we have a `.vscode/settings.json` which tells these extensions how to behave having this project opened.

## 0. Clone repo

Open a terminal, `cd` to your folder of choice and run `git clone https://github.com/fsek/WebWebWeb.git`.

Then `cd` into the newly created folder.

## 1. Python

Install Python 3.12: https://www.python.org/downloads/

Then make sure you have the right version. Open your terminal and run `python --version`.

## 2. Virtual environment

We use virtual environments to have a reproducible environment to run our project in. Create your virtual environment: `python -m venv ./.venv`.

Always activate your virtual environment when working on the project by running:

- Windows: `.\.venv\Scripts\Activate`
- MacOS: `source ./.venv/bin/activate`

You should now see (.venv) in your terminal.

Now, to point the Python extension to our venv, hit `Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P` and select `Python: Select Interpreter`. Then select the row pointing to the `./.venv/` of this project.

## 3. Installing dependencies

Our project will need packages not native to Python. FastAPI is one such dependency. The actual package files are not checked into Git. Instead, a file listing the required packages exists in the project.
The file `requirements.txt` lists all pip packages and versions needed. Install these by running:

`pip install -r ./requirements.txt`

When pulling or switching branch results in a changed `requirements.txt` you will have to re-run this command to update packages in your `.venv`.

## 4. Start server

`uvicorn main:app --reload`

Go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs for the Swagger page automatically generated by FastAPI 🎉
